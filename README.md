# Simple-Calculation-Verifyer

### Requirements

PHP 7.4.29 or higher </br>
Composer version 2.3.5 or higher  </br>
Codeigniter version 4  </br>

### Installation

Download this folder as a zip or clone this branch in your local machine.

### Run the app

Open your favorite text editor. I prefer VSCODE. Now, open the project in your text editor. Navigate to the project-root folder. This is the root folder of the project.
Now open a command prompt in this directory and enter the following command

``` php spark serve ```

Upon running this command a new CodeIgniter development server will start where the project is up and running. To visit this server open your favorite browser and go to

```  http://localhost:8080 ```

Now, you can enter all the numbers, select a operand and enter your answer and click the verify button. You will be redirected to a new page where whether 
the answer is correct or not correct is displayed using a alert message. You can can click on the link below to go back to the homepage and to verify another
operation.
